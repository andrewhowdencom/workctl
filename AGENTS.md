# Agent Instructions

This document provides conditional instructions for agents. Based on the task at hand, please refer to the relevant documentation in the `/docs/development/` directory.

Please be sure to plan so you consume files at the time they're relevant to complete the task (e.g. git just before interacting with the git tool)

## Documentation Structure & Context

The documentation in this repository is located in `/docs/development/` and follows the [Divio documentation system](https://documentation.divio.com/). It is structured into four types:

*   **Tutorials:** Learning-oriented lessons (e.g., "Tutorial: Test-Driven Development").
*   **How-to Guides:** Problem-oriented steps (e.g., "How to Design RPC Interfaces").
*   **Reference:** Information-oriented technical descriptions (e.g., "Reference: Default Timeouts for RPCs").
*   **Explanation:** Understanding-oriented background knowledge (e.g., "Explanation: Hexagonal Architecture").

Files are organized into directories by topic (e.g., `rpc/`, `git/`, `architecture/`). When you are directed to a specific file, **you should also look at other files in the same directory** to gain broader context. Often, related concepts, references, or alternative approaches are documented nearby.
