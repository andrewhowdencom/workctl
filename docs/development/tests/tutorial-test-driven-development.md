# Tutorial: Test-Driven Development

For just about all changes, make sure you develop via "test driven design". This means:

1. Write tests for the current behavior of the application
2. Modify those tests so that they verify the new desired behavior of the application
3. Modify the logic of the application based on your request, so it validates against those tests.
4. Adjust either the application or the tests until the tests pass
5. Publish the change.
