# How to Document a CLI

Where an application has a CLI (designed according to [How to Design a CLI Interface](./how-to-design-a-cli-interface.md)), it should be easily possible to either view directly or generate a comprehensive `man`
page with clear examples of how to use this application.

Additionally, the application commands and subcommands must clearly describe what each command does via the `--help`
flag, ideally with examples.
